This repository contains my notes and code examples taken from the "Python Crash Course" book by Eric Matthes. It covers Python programming fundamentals, starting with basic building blocks, variables, and data types (strings, numbers, floats). The notes progress through object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including conditional and looping statements, various methods and functions (including their types and lambda functions), and conclude with file input/output operations.
